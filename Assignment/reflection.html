        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <p>
                Problem-solving: This assignment required breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, and finding solutions to each part. This approach improved my problem-solving skills, which can be useful in many aspects of life such as working on a project in a workplace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creativity: Coding requires thinking outside the box to develop innovative solutions which was required while coding this portfolio such as ideas of how to represent a page in a unique and creative way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Logical thinking: This assignment required a logical thinking process, which improves critical thinking and decision-making abilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Persistence: Coding can be frustrating, and it often requires multiple attempts before finding the right solution. This process helped me develop persistence and resilience.

        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <p>
                Debugging: Debugging is a process of identifying and fixing errors in code. It can be time-consuming and frustrating when we encounter bugs that are difficult to identify or reproduce. When styling a page, the classes were not taking the styles I was implementing in my stylesheet. I had to do further reasearch inorder to make it work. The form validation in javascript also took some time before it started running perfectly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning new technologies: Learning new technologies can be challenging, and it can take time to become proficient in using them. JavaScript was all new to me when I started working on this unit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Time management: Deadlines are a common challenge for students, and it can be difficult to balance the demands of multiple assignments, tests, and labs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scaling: As projects grow in size or complexity, scaling becomes more challenging. I had to find ways to make the pages user-friendly while maintaining performance and reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Security: Security is a critical concern for programmers. Ensuring my code is secure and free from vulnerabilities, I had to create different backups for my code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Code optimization: I needed to write code that is optimized for performance and efficiency.

        <h2>What I Would Do Differently</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <p>
                After working this assignment, a different approach would be to start the assignment within 2-3 days it was released. This would've given me more time to plan and implement more creative ideas with the pages. 
            </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <p>
                This assignment really developed my programming skills. My confidence to code in HTML and CSS has greatly increased. While working on the styling, I had to make constant changes to make it responsive so that different screen sizes would not affect the visual appearance. It was interesting to work through the assignment and debug successfully and it motivates me to keep on working to complete the assignemnt.
